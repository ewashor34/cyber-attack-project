# Cyber-Security Project 
##### Elias Washor and Wesley Ittner



This cybersecurity dataset gives an overview of cyberattacks in different countries, industries, and years. It includes different aspects of each attack, including the nature of the threat, the method of execution, and the impact in terms of how much data was compromised and the financial damage. The timeframe in the dataset ranges from 2015 to 2024, there are 3000+ records, and there are 3 numerical variables and 7 categorical variables. Here are the variables:

- Country: Specifies the geographical location where the cyberattack occurred. We can do an analysis of which regions experience the most incidents.

- Year: Indicates when the attack took place for trend analysis over time.

- Threat Type: Classifies the type of cyber threat, such as Malware, DDoS, or Phishing, helping to identify the most common threats.

- Affected Industry: Identifies the sector targeted, such as Finance, Healthcare, or Retail, showing which industries are most vulnerable.

- Users Affected: Measures the number of users affected by the attack, we can look into the scale of data loss.

- Financial Impact ($M): Estimates the financial loss caused by the attack in millions, helping assess economic consequences.

- Vulnerability Type: What vulnerability was exploited for the attack e.g. unpatched software

- Attack Source: Where did the attack originate from: hacker group, Insider, Unknown, Nation-state

- Response Time (Hours): Records how long it took to mitigate the attack, which can indicate how prepared organizations are for stopping different levels of cybersecurity threats.

- Mitigation Strategy: Lists the countermeasures used to address the attack, such as antivirus, vpn, etc. We can then assess which strategies are most effective.

## Goal:
The goal of the project is to uncover patterns in cyberattacks across time, geography, and response strategies to aid cybersecurity efforts in the future.
